I work for [Microsoft] on [Windows Azure][] team where I (mostly) program in C#.
And in my spare time I love to play with new and interesting languages and technologies
inside and outside of "Microsoft stack"
such as Clojure, Haskell, Erlang, F#, Scala, Riak, Datomic, Storm, Akka, Hierarchical State Machines, ANTLR, etc.

I tend to forget a lot of what I learn, so I've decided to start this Blog
where I can keep and share my notes as well as practice technical writing.

I share links that I find interesting on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/109391987177502206351/posts)
and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dmitry.kakurin.9).

It will be great if others find anything useful/helpful here.
